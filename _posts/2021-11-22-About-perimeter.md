## Purpose
(Why we exist)

### Kingdom Flourishing
Kingdom Flourishing is rooted in the Hebrew word shalom and the Greek word eirene. These words are most often translated as peace in our English Bibles. Most of the time, we think of peace as being the absence of conflict. While it certainly is that, the words shalom and eirene are much richer in meaning. These words not only signify peace, but wholeness, completeness, welfare, fullness, rest and harmony. At Perimeter, the word that we use to encapsulate this biblical concept is the word flourishing. In Ephesians 2:13-14a, the Apostle Paul says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace (Greek: Eirene)."

The flourishing that we long for - the fullness of life for which we were originally created - is found only in Jesus and His kingdom as we submit  ourselves increasingly more to His benevolent rule and reign. As is pertains to where we live work and play, we long to see the gospel go forth into
our cities in such a way that people, neighborhoods, local schools, businesses, non-profits, and civil institutions are increasingly experiencing the flourishing of the kingdom of God.

## *Flourishing is living out our faith by placing ourselves in right relationship with:*
*God* - First and foremost, Jesus reconciles us to God through
faith in Him and His atoning sacrifice and resurrection, bringing
peace with God.

*Others* - The reconciling work of God through Christ is not only
vertical but also horizontal, breaking down walls of hostility,
and making enemies friends.

*Self* - As the Spirit of Christ transforms us, a right relationship
with self comes into view as we holistically experience a
reordering of desires and identity.

*World* - As all of creation groans for the day of redemption, we
bring the flourishing of God's kingdom not only to the people of
the world but also to its places.
